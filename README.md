### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Leo Walker
#### Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer
I started my data journey as a Data Analyst, focusing on leveraging SQL and different visualization tools to create descriptive analytics tools.

As I embarked on my data science journey, I found a keen interest in natural language processing (NLP). While I have delivered measurable value with techniques like regression and classification, the advent of large language models has reignited my passion for NLP, pushing me to develop on the cutting edge of this technology.

## Projects

### Resume Parser
I developed a Resume Parser project that leverages large language models for natural language processing. Hosted on Hugging Face Spaces, this project parses resumes into structured data for applications such as automated resume screening and candidate ranking. It's a testament to how NLP and machine learning can streamline complex tasks.

### VA Loan Chatbot
In an effort to innovate in the financial tech space, I created a VA Loan Chatbot. This project utilizes the Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) model on multiple VA loan books converted from PDFs. The chatbot serves as a user-friendly interface for veterans seeking information on VA loans, demonstrating the power of NLP in simplifying access to complex information.

### Nonprofit Grader - Hackathon Project
As part of a hackathon, I collaborated with a team of four on the Nonprofit Grader project. This project aims to assess and grade nonprofit organizations, providing an innovative tool for evaluating their impact and efficiency. Our approach combined data analysis with insightful metrics to create a meaningful grading system.
