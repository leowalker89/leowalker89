### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Leo Walker
#### Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer
I started my data journey as a Data Analyst focusing on leveraging SQL and different visualization tools create descriptive analytics tools.

As I started my data science journey I found an interest in natural language processing (NLP) but found that I could deliver measurable value with other techniques like regression and classification.

As large language models came onto the scene it has fueled my desire to get back into NLP and continue to develop on the cutting edge of this technology.

## Projects

### Resume Parser
I developed a Resume Parser project that leverages large language models for natural language processing. The project is hosted on Hugging Face Spaces. You can check it out [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/LeoWalker/ResumeParser).

This project parses resumes into structured data, which can be used for various applications such as automated resume screening, candidate ranking, and more. It's a great example of how NLP and machine learning can be used to automate and streamline complex tasks.


**Skills**: Python, Machine Learning, Data Visualization, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (NLP)
