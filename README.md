### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Leo, a data scientist with a new focus on large language models. 

I started my data journey as a Data Analyst focusing on leveraging SQL and different visualization tools create descriptive analytics tools.

As I started my data science journey I found an interest in natural language processing (NLP) but found that I could deliver measurable value with other techniques like regression and classification.

As large language models came onto the scene it has fueled my desire to get back into NLP and continue to develop on the cutting edge of this technology.
