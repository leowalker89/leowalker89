### Hi there üëã, Leo Walker
#### Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer
I started my data journey as a Data Analyst, focusing on leveraging SQL and different visualization tools to create descriptive analytics tools.

As I embarked on my data science journey, I became interested in natural language processing (NLP). While I have delivered measurable value with techniques like regression and classification, the advent of large language models has reignited my passion for NLP, pushing me to develop on the cutting edge of this technology.

## Projects

### SearchArena ‚öîÔ∏è
Inspired by UC Berkeley's LMSYS Chatbot Arena, I developed SearchArena - an open platform for evaluating and comparing search providers. This project allows users to compare results from Perplexity, You.com, Brave Search, and Tavily side by side. Built with Streamlit and leveraging various search APIs, SearchArena aims to encourage exploration of different search tools and showcase innovation in the search space. üîç

### Resume Parser
I developed a Resume Parser project that leverages large language models for natural language processing. Hosted on Hugging Face Spaces, this project parses resumes into structured data for applications such as automated resume screening and candidate ranking. It's a testament to how NLP and machine learning can streamline complex tasks. 
[Check it out here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/LeoWalker/ResumeParser).

### Job Description Parser
Building on the success of the Resume Parser, I created a sibling project called Job Description Parser. Similar to the Resume Parser, it has a Hugging Face Space where you can demo its capabilities in parsing job descriptions into structured data. üíº

## Hackathon Projects

### LlamaWorksDB - by team CLAB üèÜ "Best Use of LlamaIndex"
As part of a hackathon, I collaborated with Team CLAB on the LlamaWorksDB project. LlamaWorksDB is an AI-powered doc wizard that streamlines knowledge work by tapping into the documentation of multiple sponsors, including LlamaIndex, Fireworks.ai, and MongoDB, all through a single chatbot interface. üìö

Our win in the "Best Use of LlamaIndex" category was featured on the LlamaIndex blog:
[Streamlining Knowledge Work with LlamaIndex, Fireworks, and MongoDB](https://www.llamaindex.ai/blog/streamlining-knowledge-work-with-llamaindex-fireworks-and-mongodb).

**Skills**: Python, Machine Learning, Data Visualization, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (NLP)
